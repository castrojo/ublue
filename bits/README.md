# Bits

Bits are a collection of scripts that will configure layered packages to enable certain functionality or configure your desktop/environment in specific ways. You can run the ones you want and then reboot, you don't need to reboot inbetween each one. 

REMEMBER: These are workarounds, the same concerns about 3rd party repos still apply to your system, even on silverblue!

Run these to do the following:


| Bit     | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| 1password | Install 1password |
| starship-rs | Install the [Starship](https://starship.rs/) cross-shell prompt |
| tailscale | Install the [Tailscale VPN](https://tailscale.com/) |
| vscode    | Instal Visual Studio Code |
| yaru      | Install and use the Yaru theme |
| yaru-dark | Install and use the Yaru-dark theme |
